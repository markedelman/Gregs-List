Reasonable but not pixel perfect implementation of the designs provided below.
For each result item, use the same element structure and classes. In other words, you should only have to write style rules once for a search result item, and then use the same class on each individual search item. Feel free to repeat the text between search items, but try to get titles of different lengths so you can see how it impacts your layout.
The design calls for a magnifying glass icon. Use this image file (which you can download by right clicking and saving):magnifying-glass.png
Put the <input> and the element with the magnifying glass in a common <form> element. We'll do a deep dive on forms later in this unit, but for now, just know you can wrap the input element and the element you create for the magnifying glass inside a <form>.
Use semantic HTML throughout the page.
Include a page title (aka, use a <title> element) and meta description in the head.
Back up and save your work using Git and GitHub (from the command line).

Don't waste your time looking at how Craiglist (your competitor!) coded up their site, as it doesn't follow best practices.
